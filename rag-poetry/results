Question: What port/protocol is used for DNS?
Ans: The port used for DNS is UDP port 53.

--------------                                           

Question: Is that usually allowed unfettered access through enterprise firewalls?
Ans: Yes, enterprise firewalls are typically configured to allow all packets on UDP port 53 (used by DNS) since DNS is such a crucial service for virtually all applications.

Question: Describe figure 2 along with statistics
Ans: Figure 2 shows the value of attributes for detected instances (on the left) versus undetected instances (on the right) using the machine for the Research Institute. The figure provides a visual comparison of the attribute values between the detected and undetected instances. 

The accompanying statistics mentioned in the context are not provided in the given information.

Question: Describe figure 2 along with statistics in 2 sentences or less
Ans: Figure 2 shows the attribute values for detected and undetected instances using the machine for the Research Institute. Undetected instances were generally shorter in length, but there was a significant overlap in the value range between detected and undetected instances.

Question: Explain about the average time complexity of their scheme based on the table 5 in simple terms
Ans: The average time complexity of their scheme, as shown in Table V, is 800 microseconds per query name. This means that on average, it takes 800 microseconds for their system to extract attributes and detect anomalies for each DNS query.

Question: What were the attributes derived from the DNS and what were the attributes from FQFN, based on the output of this query form a list of features
Ans: Based on the given context, the features derived from the DNS and FQDN attributes could include:

1. Packet rate: The number of DNS query packets generated by enterprise hosts per second.
2. Variation in packet rate: The range of packet rates observed in the University network (150 to more than 800 pps).
3. Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN): The complete domain name of the queried host.
4. Length of FQDN: The number of characters in the FQDN.
5. Subdomain count: The number of subdomains present in the FQDN.
6. TLD (Top-Level Domain): The highest level domain in the FQDN (e.g., .com, .org, .net).
7. Query type: The type of DNS query being made (e.g., A, AAAA, MX, CNAME).
8. Query class: The class of the DNS query (e.g., IN for Internet).
9. Query flags: Any specific flags set in the DNS query packet.
10. Query payload size: The size of the DNS query payload in bytes.

Please note that this list is based on the given context, and there may be additional features that could be derived depending on the specific requirements or analysis being performed.
