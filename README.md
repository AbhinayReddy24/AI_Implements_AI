# AI_Implements_AI

This repository contains AI-Implements-AI team's report for the Generative AI Hackathon hosted by AI Tinkerer.

Project Objective: 

Our project aims to test and evaluate multiple LLMs ability to generate functional code to create a model based on an AI research paper.

Project Outline: 

As prelimianry steps we will choose 2-3 LLMs and research papers. 
Using the latter we will test and evalute the LLMs. 
We will continue our experiement by identifying fine-tuning techniques and prompt to improve our favored model.
