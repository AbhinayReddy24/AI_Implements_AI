    "In exploratory data analysis, there are several steps that need to be taken. First, you need to import the necessary modules for handling tabular data. Then, you should read the data CSV files and convert them into pandas dataframes. After that, you can investigate the data to gain a better understanding of the available features. It is not necessary to use every available feature, so you should identify the relevant ones and discard the irrelevant ones. This can help reduce the number of weak features and focus on creating meaningful features. Finally, you can perform data cleaning and feature engineering to improve the quality of the data and create new features that can enhance the performance of the model.\n",
